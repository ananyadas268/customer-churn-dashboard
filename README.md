💡 Project Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard is an interactive machine learning web app built with Streamlit that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to leave the service (churn). It empowers businesses to identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention actions.

The model analyzes customer demographics, payment methods, service usage, and contract types to determine churn probability. The dashboard also provides clear visual explanations such as model performance, churn distribution, and feature importance.
